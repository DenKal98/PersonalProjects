# Second Project

## Explanation of Project
A British challenger bank collected data about the performance of their loans issued from
2009 to 2015. They would like to use the data to build a model to help their credit
analysts assess new loan applications, i.e. predict if a loan would be repaid in full or
defaulted on. 

The loans.csv dataset contains ~230k examples and 31 different variables.
A description of these variables is provided in **data-dictionary.csv.**

Requirement for this project: 
 - Analyse this data and prepare a short presentation (15 minutes)
 - exploratory data analysis or summary statistics (quantitative)
 - interpretation and context (qualitative)
 
Your analysis must include, but need not be limited to, the following points:

1) Develop a model (Model-1) that, given all available variables, predicts the
probability of default at the time of application;
2) Identify which variable is the most predictive of loan performance;
3) Identify any highly correlated pair of variables;
4) Develop a second model (Model-2) that uses only 5 of the provided variables –
explain your choice;
5) Compare Model-1 and Model-2 – explain your choice of metrics
