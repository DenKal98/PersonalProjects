# Second Project

## Explanation of Project
A British challenger bank collected data about the performance of their loans issued from
2009 to 2015. They would like to use the data to build a model to help their credit
analysts assess new loan applications, i.e. predict if a loan would be repaid in full or
defaulted on. The loans.csv dataset contains ~230k examples and 31 different variables.
A description of these variables is provided in data-dictionary.csv.
You are required to analyse these data and prepare a short presentation (15 minutes)
explaining your analysis and conclusions. This should include any quantitative
(exploratory data analysis or summary statistics) or qualitative (interpretation and
context) insights gained from the data. Please note this is a real dataset and so may
require some cleaning.
Your analysis must include, but need not be limited to, the following points:
1) Develop a model (Model-1) that, given all available variables, predicts the
probability of default at the time of application;
2) Identify which variable is the most predictive of loan performance;
3) Identify any highly correlated pair of variables;
4) Develop a second model (Model-2) that uses only 5 of the provided variables –
explain your choice;
5) Compare Model-1 and Model-2 – explain your choice of metrics
